In this Challange we were given two seperate data sets and were required to break down, sort and analyse them using the corr basics of Python. it was used to text out knowledge on all we learned about python up until this point with an emphasis on how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries.

The other primary use of this challange was to demenstrate the limitation of excel and coding within excel compared to pythons capabilities.

For the first data set We were given a data set regadrding budgeting data The task was to use python to find these five values within the data

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
The second task was to analyse a data set about elections for this set we needed to use python to find these five things

    The total number of votes cast

    A complete list of candidates who received votes

    The percentage of votes each candidate won

    The total number of votes each candidate won

    The winner of the election based on popular vote
After completing each of these challanges we then had to print the findings to our terminal as well as the original directory from whih we gained the data as a an alternate file

Completion process I would first attempt to find each of these value using my memory, then i would lookinto the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when i was lost. After doing these steps i would consult ChatGPT to find out where i went wrong and would use its assitance to correct the code as well as explain its proccess to me so i could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid.
